          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            I'm Monica, an enthusiastic apprentice at Code the Dream (CTD) based in North Carolina.

            Something interesting about me is that I am a fan of psychology, philosophy and history. In my home country I studied psychology and civil engineering . I have always wondered how our species created this universe in what is now a little machine called a computer, with which we can create, share and grow. This motivated me to change my path and start a career as a web developer. Drawing, designing and teaching are part of my passions too. When I am not working/studying I spend time reading, whatching a good tv show, eating delicious things, working out and enjoying time with my family.
