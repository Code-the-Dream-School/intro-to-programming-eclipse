                <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Worked at a chiropractic clinic until it was closed due to pandemic shelter-in-place orders. A few weeks afterwards, Blatteis Realty put up the worksite for lease, the neighboring storefront demolished and under new construction. Reemployment is unlikely when pandemic restrictions end.</p>
