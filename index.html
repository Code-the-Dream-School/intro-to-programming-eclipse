About: I am foremost a perprtual student. I have never lost the drive to learn and take on new adventures. 
After years of being a small business owner, I am tranistioning into a new career in software development. 
I look forward to working in a team environment for a company that makes this world a little bit better in someway. 
I am at the beginning of this new venture and I am enjoying the process.

I work directly with clients behind the chair as their stylist I also manage and oversee every aspect of owning a business.
In software developement, I am a graduate of Code Tenderlion's courses of Code Ramp and Ramp++
totally 150 hours of JavaScript education. I am currently enrolled in Code the Dream Bootcamp.
