About
I'm from Mexico but raised in North Carolina. Grew up in a lower income family
but parents always made a point to take school seriously and study hard.
I currently work as a automation technician/electrician in a manufacturing 
plant where we make transmission for Toyota vehicles. Main job function consists
of troubleshooting hardware issues in CNC robo drills. No prior knowledge of 
any programming language other than Programmable Logistic Controller ladder
logic or Boolean logic but always had a strong interest in coding.

Experience
Currently a automation technician/electrician.
Have some community college education in electronics. 
Worked in the oil/gas industry in frac sites.
Drove over the road as a commercial driver with a commercial driver's license. 
Was a mechanic for the National Guard to work on helicopters.
