/* About
When I am not studying or working in college, I teach myself programming and collaborate with other people on various projects.
I believe that is where my passion lies. By programming, I train myself to think.
The best advice I received was 'If you fail at first, you call it version 1.0'.
I now have empathy for issues alongside an appreciation for the structure, order, and quality. 
I strive to build impactful projects that people could use in everyday life.
