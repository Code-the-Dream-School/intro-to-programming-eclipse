About
Hi! I'm Hanna and I'm a future Software Engineer. I'm a student of software engineering bootcamp Code The Dream and I really like to code and learn something new. I'm planning to be good at the next software developing technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SASS/LESS, Git, npm.
Experience 
I have already made a couple of websites using HTML and CSS - One of them is non-adaptive and the second one is adaptive. You can take a look at these websites in my Github account (see the link below).
