      <p>
        I am foremost a perprtual student. I have never lost the drive to learn
        and take on new adventures. After years of being a small business owner,
        I am tranistioning into a new career in software development. I look
        forward to working in a team environment for a company that makes this
        world a little bit better in someway. I am at the beginning of this new
        venture and I am enjoying the process.
